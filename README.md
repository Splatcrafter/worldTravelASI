# World Travel ASI Fork

   Fork chain:

   1. **[WorldTravelTeam/ASI](https://github.com/WorldTravelTeam/ASI)** — the original mod, discontinued January 2025.
   2. **googleplex2010/worldTravelASI** — first community fork, the immediate upstream of this repo.
   3. **This repo** — fork of googleplex2010's fork, with fixes for GTA V **build 3788 and newer** (the December 2025 update line onward).

   Two diff sections follow:

   - *Changes from upstream (googleplex2010/worldTravelASI)* lists fixes
     that googleplex2010 already carried over the original WorldTravelTeam
     baseline. Reproduced here so readers know the full set of patches
     in the binary, not because this repo authored them.
   - *Changes in this fork (against googleplex2010/worldTravelASI)* lists
     diffs that this repo applies on top of googleplex2010 — i.e. what is
     actually new here.

  ## Changes in this fork (against googleplex2010/worldTravelASI)
  
  - **`WorldTravelPatches/src/Water.cpp`** (`Water::Init`): rewritten on
    2026-05-10 to fix the Liberty City water suppression box on build 3788
    (and any future build where this hook silently mis-installs). The
    upstream version did six `hook::get_address` reads at hardcoded offsets
    inside the resolved `switchWater` function body and committed the
    results to statics with no validation; if any single offset was stale,
    `bd_min_x/min_y/max_x/max_y` ended up pointing into unrelated memory
    and the LC water plane rendered offset from the island (visible as
    "water hole" sitting next to LC instead of over it, flooding subway
    and tunnels). The new implementation:
      1. Counts pattern matches and bails with an error log on != 1.
      2. Sanity-checks every derived pointer against the **runtime**
         ASI image range computed via `hook::getRVA(0)` and
         `hook::getRVA(hook::exe_end() - 0x140000000)`. The static
         `0x140000000..0x146000000` constants are the PE base before ASLR;
         comparing post-relocation runtime addresses (`0x7FF7_xxxx_xxxx` on
         x64) against them never matches — a subtle bug that makes a naive
         range check skip every install.
      3. Stages the six derived pointers in locals and only commits to the
         statics + installs the function-stub hook if **all** reads pass
         the range check. A half-wired hook used to scribble into random
         memory on the first level switch.
      4. Logs every step via `sprintf_s` (same reason as PopZones — the
         bundled spdlog `{}` placeholders fail silently in this build of
         the format library).

   ## Changes from upstream (googleplex2010/worldTravelASI)

   - **`WorldTravelPatches/src/PopZones.h`**: Loosened pattern 2's jump-distance
     byte from `EB 5F` to `EB ?` for GTA V build 3751+. Rockstar inserted ~4 bytes
     of code in the branch target between the original and current build, shifting
     the jump distance.
   - **`WorldTravelPatches/src/PopZones.h`**: Added per-pattern diagnostic logging
     using `sprintf_s`-based message formatting (the bundled spdlog version's `{}`
     placeholders fail silently). Each pattern now logs match count and patch result.
   - **`WorldTravelPatches/src/PopZones.h`**: Replaced fail-fast assertions with
     graceful logging and skip behavior. A broken pattern no longer kills the entire
     init thread, so subsequent patches still install.
   - **`WorldTravel/src/Minimap.cpp`**: Same diagnostic + graceful-failure treatment
     applied to both minimap pattern hooks.

   ## Known issues (not fixed)

   - **Live HUD minimap renders transparent in Liberty City.** Pause map is fine.
     Cause: the `v_fakelibertycity` interior trigger present in the January 2025
     binary release was removed from the May 2025 source. Restoring requires
     reverse-engineering the original binary's use of that string and reimplementing
     the missing function.
   - **LSPDFR logs "No game zone found" warnings at LC coordinates.** Cause: GTA V's
     named-zone system appears to be hardcoded in the executable; LCPP includes no
     named-zone metadata for Liberty City. Fix would require an ASI-level hook on
     `GAMEPLAY::GET_NAME_OF_ZONE` to map LC coordinates to zone codes from
     popzone.ipl. Cosmetic-only impact.

   ## Building

   ### Visual Studio 2022 (original path)

   1. Open `WorldTravelPatches/src/WorldTravelPatches.sln` (or
      `WorldTravel/src/WorldTravel.sln`) in Visual Studio 2022
   2. Right-click solution → Retarget Solution → pick installed Windows SDK
   3. Set configuration to Release / x64
   4. Build (Ctrl+Shift+B)
   5. Output ASI lands in `bin/x64/Release/`

   ### CLion / CMake (Linux dev container)

   The repo ships CMake build files alongside the SLN so CLion can load and
   navigate the project. Two cross-toolchains are wired up:

   - **`cmake/toolchain-clang-cl-xwin.cmake`** — clang-cl + lld-link targeting
     the MSVC ABI, with headers and import libs supplied by
     [`xwin`](https://github.com/Jake-Shadle/xwin). This is the path that can
     produce a real `.asi` from Linux.
   - **`cmake/toolchain-mingw-w64-x86_64.cmake`** — mingw-w64 + posix threads.
     Compiles the source for static analysis and IDE feature coverage; the
     final link fails on the MSVC-only `.lib`s, so this is editor-only.

   #### Setup

   Inside the bundled dev container nothing extra is needed: the Dockerfile
   bakes xwin, the splatted MSVC SDK (VS 2019 manifest, picked because Clang 14
   from Debian 12 can't parse the newer STL), `lld-link`, and a MinHook source
   tree into `/opt/wtasi-toolchain/`. `post-create.sh` runs
   `cmake/strip-mojito-ltcg.sh` once on container creation to write the
   LTCG-stripped mojito-wt to `/opt/wtasi-toolchain/mojito-wt-clean.lib`.
   Container rebuilds redo the strip step but reuse the image-baked toolchain.

   Outside the dev container (e.g. on a plain Linux host you maintain
   yourself), reproduce the same layout under `~/.local/`:

   ```bash
   # xwin
   curl -sSfL https://github.com/Jake-Shadle/xwin/releases/download/0.9.0/xwin-0.9.0-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz \
       | tar -xz -C /tmp
   install -m 755 /tmp/xwin-0.9.0-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/xwin ~/.local/bin/xwin
   xwin --accept-license --manifest-version 16 --arch x86_64 \
       --cache-dir ~/.xwin-cache splat --output ~/.xwin

   # lld-link from the Debian lld-14 .deb
   curl -sSfL -o /tmp/lld-14.deb \
       http://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/l/llvm-toolchain-14/lld-14_14.0.6-12_amd64.deb
   dpkg-deb -x /tmp/lld-14.deb ~/.local/lld-extract
   ln -sf ~/.local/lld-extract/usr/lib/llvm-14/bin/lld-link ~/.local/bin/lld-link

   # MinHook source (vendored libMinHook-x64-v141-md.lib is MSVC LTCG bitcode
   # that lld-link can't consume; building from upstream yields plain COFF)
   git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/TsudaKageyu/minhook.git /tmp/minhook
   mkdir -p ~/.local/minhook-build/src/hde ~/.local/minhook-build/include
   cp /tmp/minhook/src/{buffer.c,buffer.h,hook.c,trampoline.c,trampoline.h} ~/.local/minhook-build/src/
   cp /tmp/minhook/src/hde/{hde64.c,hde64.h,pstdint.h,table64.h} ~/.local/minhook-build/src/hde/
   cp /tmp/minhook/include/MinHook.h ~/.local/minhook-build/include/
   cp .devcontainer/wtasi-toolchain-files/minhook-CMakeLists.txt ~/.local/minhook-build/CMakeLists.txt

   # Strip the LTCG bundled MinHook out of mojito-wt-md.lib
   ./cmake/strip-mojito-ltcg.sh
   ```

   The CMake toolchain file probes `/opt/wtasi-toolchain/` first and falls
   back to `~/.local/` automatically, so either layout works from the same
   `cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=…` invocation.

   #### Configure and build

   ```bash
   cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja \
       -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/toolchain-clang-cl-xwin.cmake \
       -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
   cmake --build build
   ```

   In CLion: **File → Open** the repo, accept the CMake project, then in
   **Settings → Build, Execution, Deployment → CMake** add a profile with
   the toolchain file in *CMake options*:
   `-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/toolchain-clang-cl-xwin.cmake`.

   #### What builds

   Both targets land in `build/bin/x64/Release/` after `cmake --build build`:

   - **`WorldTravel.asi`** — links via clang-cl + xwin + locally-built MinHook.
   - **`WorldTravelPatches.asi`** — links the same way, plus the LTCG-stripped
     mojito-wt produced by `cmake/strip-mojito-ltcg.sh`.

   The mojito-wt cleaning step is the non-obvious one: the vendored
   `mojito-wt-md.lib` ships mojito's own (plain COFF) code alongside an
   internal copy of MinHook v141 compiled with `/GL`. Only the bundled MinHook
   members are LTCG bytecode; lld-link rejects them outright. The helper
   script extracts every mojito-own `.obj`, drops the libminhook + d3d11
   members, and re-archives the result with `llvm-lib`. We then satisfy
   MinHook from upstream source instead.
