# World Travel ASI Fork

   Fork chain:

   1. **[WorldTravelTeam/ASI](https://github.com/WorldTravelTeam/ASI)** — the original mod, discontinued January 2025.
   2. **googleplex2010/worldTravelASI** — first community fork, the immediate upstream of this repo.
   3. **This repo** — fork of googleplex2010's fork, with fixes for GTA V **build 3788 and newer** (the December 2025 update line onward).

   Two diff sections follow:

   - *Changes from upstream (googleplex2010/worldTravelASI)* lists fixes
     that googleplex2010 already carried over the original WorldTravelTeam
     baseline. Reproduced here so readers know the full set of patches
     in the binary, not because this repo authored them.
   - *Changes in this fork (against googleplex2010/worldTravelASI)* lists
     diffs that this repo applies on top of googleplex2010 — i.e. what is
     actually new here.

  ## Changes in this fork (against googleplex2010/worldTravelASI)
  
  - **`WorldTravelPatches/src/Water.cpp`** (`Water::Init`): rewritten on
    2026-05-10 to fix the Liberty City water suppression box on build 3788
    (and any future build where this hook silently mis-installs). The
    upstream version did six `hook::get_address` reads at hardcoded offsets
    inside the resolved `switchWater` function body and committed the
    results to statics with no validation; if any single offset was stale,
    `bd_min_x/min_y/max_x/max_y` ended up pointing into unrelated memory
    and the LC water plane rendered offset from the island (visible as
    "water hole" sitting next to LC instead of over it, flooding subway
    and tunnels). The new implementation:
      1. Counts pattern matches and bails with an error log on != 1.
      2. Sanity-checks every derived pointer against the **runtime**
         ASI image range computed via `hook::getRVA(0)` and
         `hook::getRVA(hook::exe_end() - 0x140000000)`. The static
         `0x140000000..0x146000000` constants are the PE base before ASLR;
         comparing post-relocation runtime addresses (`0x7FF7_xxxx_xxxx` on
         x64) against them never matches — a subtle bug that makes a naive
         range check skip every install.
      3. Stages the six derived pointers in locals and only commits to the
         statics + installs the function-stub hook if **all** reads pass
         the range check. A half-wired hook used to scribble into random
         memory on the first level switch.
      4. Logs every step via `sprintf_s` (same reason as PopZones — the
         bundled spdlog `{}` placeholders fail silently in this build of
         the format library).

  - **`WorldTravel/src/Minimap.cpp`** (`TriggerLibertyCityRadarInterior` +
    hardened `Minimap_Hooks`): added on 2026-05-10 to fix the transparent
    Liberty City minimap and pause map on build 3788 onward. Resolves the
    long-standing "Live HUD minimap renders transparent in Liberty City"
    known-issue. The May-2025 source drop had stripped the per-frame radar
    trigger that was present in the Jan-2025 binary release; without it,
    the LS-bitmap-suppression hooks fire correctly but nothing tells the
    radar renderer to substitute the LC tiles, so the minimap stays empty.
    Recovered by static disassembly of the legacy Dec-2024 `WorldTravel.asi`
    at VMA `0x1800229e0`: a per-frame loop that, while the player is in LC,
    issues `SET_RADAR_AS_EXTERIOR_THIS_FRAME` (clears any prior interior
    state), `GET_HASH_KEY("v_fakelibertycity")`, then
    `SET_RADAR_AS_INTERIOR_THIS_FRAME(hash, LibertyCityGFXPos[0],
    LibertyCityGFXPos[1], 0, 0)`. Reimplemented 1:1 in `Minimap.cpp` and
    wired into `MinimapMain`. Also took the opportunity to apply the same
    diagnostic + graceful-fail treatment to the two existing
    `Minimap_Hooks` pattern installs so future Rockstar build bumps log
    rather than silently mis-install.

  - **`WorldTravel/src/Level.{h,cpp}` + `LevelSwitch.cpp`** (`IPLsLODLights`
    group support): added on 2026-05-13 to give any level an optional LOD-light
    IPL group. `Level::ReadFiles` now also looks for
    `Levels/<name>/IPLsLODLights.txt`; if the file exists, the parsed IPLs are
    loaded by `LoadLevel`, unloaded by `UnloadLevel`, and removed-if-active by
    `DisableActiveFiles`, alongside the other groups. A new per-level
    `loadLodLights` flag (default `true`) gates whether the group is applied
    on level entry; `levelSwitch::Init` flips Liberty City's flag to the
    existing user-facing `Settings::EnableLibertyCityLODLights` value so the
    pre-existing INI setting now drives a level-managed IPL group instead of
    only the standalone LC nighttime-light request blocks. Any other level
    just needs to ship the file to opt in.

  - **1.2.1 — `WorldTravel/src/Ipl.{h,cpp}` + `IplGroup.{h,cpp}` +
    `Level.{h,cpp}` + `LevelSwitch.cpp`** (pre-teleport `iplState` snapshot
    + FlightController typo fixes): added on 2026-05-15 to fix the
    "physical Los Santos map is missing after returning from Liberty City"
    bug. Two independent defects both poisoned the saved `iplState` for LS,
    which is the only level that consults it on reload (LS sets
    `defaultMap=true`, so `Level::LoadLevel` calls
    `RequestIplGroup(checkState=true)` — IPLs whose `iplState` reads `false`
    get silently skipped). NY/CP/SF use `defaultMap=false` →
    `checkState=false` and are unaffected; the radar/minimap and pause map
    have their own asset paths so they keep rendering, hiding the fact
    that the actual world geometry never re-streamed.

    1. **Streaming-thread race in `PerformTeleport` / `SwitchMap`.** Both
       flows teleport the player to `(11000, 11000, 1500)` *before* calling
       `losSantos.UnloadLevel()`. Within that single script frame GTA's
       streaming thread reacts to the position jump and begins tearing
       down LS IPLs, so `IS_IPL_ACTIVE` inside `Ipl::SetIplState()`
       (called by `Ipl::RemoveIpl(saveState=true)`) can already return
       `false` for IPLs that were genuinely active a millisecond earlier.
       The wrong `false` gets saved, the matching `LoadLevel` on the
       return trip skips the request, and LS comes back as an empty
       skybox. Fix: new `Level::CaptureIplStates()` walks every tracked
       IPL group and snapshots `IS_IPL_ACTIVE` *while the player is still
       standing in the level*, called from both `PerformTeleport` and
       `SwitchMap` right after `SetPlayerLocationID(-1)` and before the
       away-teleport. A new `Ipl::iplStateCaptured` latch makes the
       subsequent in-Unload auto-snapshot a no-op when an explicit capture
       already happened, while leaving the auto-snapshot intact for code
       paths (AirportTravel, DocksTravel, FlightController) that don't go
       through `CaptureIplStates()`. `Ipl::SetIplName` deliberately does
       *not* raise the latch — at startup the streaming system has not
       necessarily finished activating every default IPL, so the first
       real unload should still get to refresh that placeholder.
    2. **Two copy-paste typos in `FlightController`** at the LC→LS and
       LC→CP flight-trigger boundaries:
       `losSantos.UnloadLevel()` where `LoadLevel()` was intended (the
       arrival, not the departure), and the matching
       `cayoPerico.UnloadLevel()` typo. Anyone who once flew back from LC
       to LS instead of fast-travelling permanently poisoned LS's
       `iplState` (the rogue Unload snapshotted "currently inactive"
       because the player had just been teleported far away), making
       every subsequent F11 → LS surface bug #1's symptom even though
       the F11 path itself wasn't to blame.

  - **1.2.2 — `WorldTravel/src/ZonedModel.cpp`** (vehicle un-suppression
    fix): added on 2026-05-17 to fix bug reports of LSPD vehicles spawning
    in Liberty City after the 1.2.1 streaming fix landed. The hot path is
    `ZonedModel::SetZonedModelSuppressed(bool isSuppressed, bool type)`:
    the vehicle branch had a hard-coded `true` instead of forwarding the
    `isSuppressed` parameter to `SET_VEHICLE_MODEL_IS_SUPPRESSED`, so
    every call — including the un-suppression that `LoadLevel` issues for
    the destination map's vehicles — actually re-suppressed the model.
    Vehicles entered a one-way trap: once any transition touched a
    `ZonedVehicles.txt` entry, that model could not come back. The ped
    branch (`SET_PED_MODEL_IS_SUPPRESSED`) was already correct, which is
    why the symptom was vehicle-only.

    This bug had been latent since the initial fork commit; pre-1.2.1 it
    was masked because LS IPLs themselves never re-streamed after a LC
    round-trip (no world geometry, no vehicle spawns to notice), so the
    leaky suppression state went undetected. Fixing the IPL pipeline in
    1.2.1 restored a working spawn loop and surfaced the suppression
    failure. Fix is a one-liner: forward `isSuppressed` to the native
    instead of passing `true`. Resolves the "LSPD cars occasionally
    appearing in Liberty City after fast travel" report.

   ## Changes from upstream (googleplex2010/worldTravelASI)

   - **`WorldTravelPatches/src/PopZones.h`**: Loosened pattern 2's jump-distance
     byte from `EB 5F` to `EB ?` for GTA V build 3751+. Rockstar inserted ~4 bytes
     of code in the branch target between the original and current build, shifting
     the jump distance.
   - **`WorldTravelPatches/src/PopZones.h`**: Added per-pattern diagnostic logging
     using `sprintf_s`-based message formatting (the bundled spdlog version's `{}`
     placeholders fail silently). Each pattern now logs match count and patch result.
   - **`WorldTravelPatches/src/PopZones.h`**: Replaced fail-fast assertions with
     graceful logging and skip behavior. A broken pattern no longer kills the entire
     init thread, so subsequent patches still install.
   - **`WorldTravel/src/Minimap.cpp`**: Same diagnostic + graceful-failure treatment
     applied to both minimap pattern hooks.

   ## Known issues (not fixed)

   - **LSPDFR logs "No game zone found" warnings at LC coordinates.** Cause: GTA V's
     named-zone system appears to be hardcoded in the executable; LCPP includes no
     named-zone metadata for Liberty City. Fix would require an ASI-level hook on
     `GAMEPLAY::GET_NAME_OF_ZONE` to map LC coordinates to zone codes from
     popzone.ipl. Cosmetic-only impact.

   ## Building

   ### Visual Studio 2022 (original path)

   1. Open `WorldTravelPatches/src/WorldTravelPatches.sln` (or
      `WorldTravel/src/WorldTravel.sln`) in Visual Studio 2022
   2. Right-click solution → Retarget Solution → pick installed Windows SDK
   3. Set configuration to Release / x64
   4. Build (Ctrl+Shift+B)
   5. Output ASI lands in `bin/x64/Release/`

   ### CLion / CMake (Linux dev container)

   The repo ships CMake build files alongside the SLN so CLion can load and
   navigate the project. Two cross-toolchains are wired up:

   - **`cmake/toolchain-clang-cl-xwin.cmake`** — clang-cl + lld-link targeting
     the MSVC ABI, with headers and import libs supplied by
     [`xwin`](https://github.com/Jake-Shadle/xwin). This is the path that can
     produce a real `.asi` from Linux.
   - **`cmake/toolchain-mingw-w64-x86_64.cmake`** — mingw-w64 + posix threads.
     Compiles the source for static analysis and IDE feature coverage; the
     final link fails on the MSVC-only `.lib`s, so this is editor-only.

   #### Setup

   Inside the bundled dev container nothing extra is needed: the Dockerfile
   bakes xwin, the splatted MSVC SDK (VS 2019 manifest, picked because Clang 14
   from Debian 12 can't parse the newer STL), `lld-link`, and a MinHook source
   tree into `/opt/wtasi-toolchain/`. `post-create.sh` runs
   `cmake/strip-mojito-ltcg.sh` once on container creation to write the
   LTCG-stripped mojito-wt to `/opt/wtasi-toolchain/mojito-wt-clean.lib`.
   Container rebuilds redo the strip step but reuse the image-baked toolchain.

   Outside the dev container (e.g. on a plain Linux host you maintain
   yourself), reproduce the same layout under `~/.local/`:

   ```bash
   # xwin
   curl -sSfL https://github.com/Jake-Shadle/xwin/releases/download/0.9.0/xwin-0.9.0-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz \
       | tar -xz -C /tmp
   install -m 755 /tmp/xwin-0.9.0-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/xwin ~/.local/bin/xwin
   xwin --accept-license --manifest-version 16 --arch x86_64 \
       --cache-dir ~/.xwin-cache splat --output ~/.xwin

   # lld-link from the Debian lld-14 .deb
   curl -sSfL -o /tmp/lld-14.deb \
       http://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/l/llvm-toolchain-14/lld-14_14.0.6-12_amd64.deb
   dpkg-deb -x /tmp/lld-14.deb ~/.local/lld-extract
   ln -sf ~/.local/lld-extract/usr/lib/llvm-14/bin/lld-link ~/.local/bin/lld-link

   # MinHook source (vendored libMinHook-x64-v141-md.lib is MSVC LTCG bitcode
   # that lld-link can't consume; building from upstream yields plain COFF)
   git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/TsudaKageyu/minhook.git /tmp/minhook
   mkdir -p ~/.local/minhook-build/src/hde ~/.local/minhook-build/include
   cp /tmp/minhook/src/{buffer.c,buffer.h,hook.c,trampoline.c,trampoline.h} ~/.local/minhook-build/src/
   cp /tmp/minhook/src/hde/{hde64.c,hde64.h,pstdint.h,table64.h} ~/.local/minhook-build/src/hde/
   cp /tmp/minhook/include/MinHook.h ~/.local/minhook-build/include/
   cp .devcontainer/wtasi-toolchain-files/minhook-CMakeLists.txt ~/.local/minhook-build/CMakeLists.txt

   # Strip the LTCG bundled MinHook out of mojito-wt-md.lib
   ./cmake/strip-mojito-ltcg.sh
   ```

   The CMake toolchain file probes `/opt/wtasi-toolchain/` first and falls
   back to `~/.local/` automatically, so either layout works from the same
   `cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=…` invocation.

   #### Configure and build

   ```bash
   cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja \
       -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/toolchain-clang-cl-xwin.cmake \
       -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
   cmake --build build
   ```

   In CLion: **File → Open** the repo, accept the CMake project, then in
   **Settings → Build, Execution, Deployment → CMake** add a profile with
   the toolchain file in *CMake options*:
   `-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/toolchain-clang-cl-xwin.cmake`.

   #### What builds

   Both targets land in `build/bin/x64/Release/` after `cmake --build build`:

   - **`WorldTravel.asi`** — links via clang-cl + xwin + locally-built MinHook.
   - **`WorldTravelPatches.asi`** — links the same way, plus the LTCG-stripped
     mojito-wt produced by `cmake/strip-mojito-ltcg.sh`.

   The mojito-wt cleaning step is the non-obvious one: the vendored
   `mojito-wt-md.lib` ships mojito's own (plain COFF) code alongside an
   internal copy of MinHook v141 compiled with `/GL`. Only the bundled MinHook
   members are LTCG bytecode; lld-link rejects them outright. The helper
   script extracts every mojito-own `.obj`, drops the libminhook + d3d11
   members, and re-archives the result with `llvm-lib`. We then satisfy
   MinHook from upstream source instead.
